# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a working X link to the “Join Community” CTA and introduce a new “Flubby Gallery” section featuring new Flubby images with motivational captions.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Closing CTA “Join Community” to link to https://x.com/ar94595, opening in a new tab with safe external-link attributes and an English label indicating X.
- Add a new landing-page section titled “Flubby Gallery” that displays at least 6 new static Flubby images with short, relatable motivational captions in English.
- Add the new gallery images as static assets under the generated-assets location and reference them by exact filename from the gallery, including English alt text.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click “Join on X” (or similar) to open the X community link in a new tab, and can browse a new Flubby Gallery of motivational images and captions on the landing page.
